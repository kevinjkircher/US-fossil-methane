The spreadsheet US-methane-data.csv contains pre-processed input data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Information Administration.

The MATLAB script methane.m uses the data from US-methane-data.csv to adjust the EPA estimates of US net greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2022 to reflect a large body of independent measurements of methane emissions from natural gas infrastructure.
